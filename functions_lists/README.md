# Part I: A First Start Writing Functions

* [What are Functions?](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp)
*  [What is a main() Function](https://realpython.com/python-main-function/)
* What are [Built-In Functions?](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_functions.asp)

    * Exercise : Set up a project in your IDE and create your own main() function.
    * Exercise : create a function named "hello()" that prints your name ?

# Part II: Operations with Lists

* [What are Lists?](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp)

* [Manipulating Lists](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/python-list-manipulation)


## Creating a List

    Exercise: Download the file [countries.txt](https://github.com/pyladieshamburg/python-essentials-series/blob/master/functions_lists/data/countries.txt)

    Exercise: Create a list [by reading the file contents](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/328059/create-a-list-that-contain-each-line-of-a-file)

## Length of List: 
 Often we want to know how many elements are present in the list.
 
    * Exercise: Given a list of countries, return the number of countries in the list. Hint See [Built-In Functions](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_functions.asp)

## [Traversing a List:]

A frequent operations on a list is visiting every element in the list, [traversing a List](https://www.w3schools.com/python/showpython.asp?filename=demo_list_loop) 


    * Exercise: How many countries names are there for each letter of the alphabet?
     
     
## Slicing a List:

Another frequent operations on a list is selecting part of the list, [slicint a List](https://www.pythoncentral.io/how-to-slice-listsarrays-and-tuples-in-python/) 


    * Exercise: Given a start and end number bounded by the number of countries, return the countries whose positions match the range.

## More Operations with Lists:
    * Exercise: Given a letter of the alphabet, return countries names that start with the given letter.
    * Exercise: Given a country name, return its position in the list.
    * Exercise: Given a list return, a shuffled list.

 # Advanced Exercises 
 
 * Surprise Topic
 * Generators : What are they, how do they differ from lists? Why would you use a generator?
 * Web Scraping : Where did the list of countries come from...? 
 
 Exercise: Practice scraping this [web page](https://www.dfa.ie/travel/travel-advice/a-z-list-of-countries/) using 
 [Requests-HTML](https://html.python-requests.org/)
