### [_Survey: Are you attending PyConDE and PyData  : Berlin October 9 - 13 2019?_](https://de.pycon.org/)

## Create a Python Virtual Environment: 

A virtual environment a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects
separate by creating isolated python code for each of the projects. If you are new to creating Python 
virtual environments, refer to the instructions in 
[Creating a Virtual Environment with Python](https://github.com/pyladieshamburg/getting-started-with-python#create-a-virtual-environment-with-python-3)
  

## Create a Working Directory for Your Code

* Create a directory named "dice" where your code and enviroment with will placed. 


    `mkdir dice`
    
* Change into the "dice" directory:


    `cd dice`

* Create a Python virtual environment


    `python3 -m venv dice-env`

* Activate the newly created virtual environment


    `source dice-env/bin/activate`



##  Install PyCharm Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

An IDE is a software suite that consolidates basic tools required to write and test software. We will use PyCharm Community Edition.


* [Download PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

* Following the installation instruction for your operating system


## Setting up Your First PyCharm Project with a Python Virtual Environment


* Launch PyCharm

* Select "Create New Project"

![](images/Create%20Project.png)

* Locate the "..." symbol. It is on  the __far right, top corner__

* Select working directory name : 'dice'

* Select "Create Project"



## Choose an Interpreter 

Choosing which interpreter to use for a project is an important decision. 
Python is a script language, which means that your code is converted to machine code by a Python interpreter.
You can have multiple versions of Python installed on your computer, and you need to choose the one youâ€™d like for this project.

* Choose the interpreter that is in the dice-env folder:

### Steps for Choosing the dice-env Interpreter



Then, follow these steps:

* Click triangle : next to : Project Interpreter: Existing interpreter`
* Selectradio button `Existing interpreter` 
* Select wheel icon
* Select `Add local`
* Select `Virtualenv Environment`
* Select symbol `...`
* find folder : "dice/dice-env/bin/python3"
* Select `OK` : to accept the folder
* Select `OK` : again, to add local
* Select `Create` : to create the project
* Select `Yes at the following prompt:  `Create Project : The is not empty. Would you like to create a project from existing sources instead?`

## Running  Your First Python Project

* Create a new Python file

## Python Syntax : Enough to Get Started

[Python Syntax](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_syntax.asp)

[Python Code Layout:](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#id16)


* Enter this python code into the file:

`print("Hello World: My Nane is <YOUR NAME HERE> ")`

## Run Hello World

##  Project : Roll the Dice  


Random numbers are generated  for various reason: 

* Random Sampling and choosing elements from the population
* Shuffle the sequence data. Seed the random generator.
* Generate random strings and password.
* Use the UUID module to generate unique IDs

Your first project will be to learn and use random number generators in Python, practicing with *Roll a Dice*

![](images/die.jpeg)

Code  you will need : 


* import package
* print statement
* Random Number Generator 

Here are some links to help you get started:
