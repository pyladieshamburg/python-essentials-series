# python-essentials-series
In the Essential Python Series we embark on a hands-on immersion into different aspects of the Python language, build small projects and learn Pythonic practices along the way.

## First Steps 


In this session, we start installing  PyCharm Community Edition Integrated Development
Environment (IDE). You will:
 
* set up your first PyCharm project with a python virtual environment
* run  your first python project
* understand python code layout and learn enough Python syntax to get you started with your Roll the Dice Project

For those who want to learn more, there is an additional project,  and a quiz to 
  assess  what you have learned...let's take our [first steps..](https://github.com/pyladieshamburg/python-essentials-series/tree/master/first-steps)!
  
## Operations with Functions and Lists : Parallel Tracks 

Now that you are comfortable setting up and using an IDE, its time to start putting your skills to good by 
thinking about and writing your *own* Python code.
 
As you embark on your code writing journey, it is good practice to organize your work in a  modular and reusable manner -  
this is where [Functions] can help.

What will our Functions do? ... You guessed it ... operate on [Lists]. 

Advanced: Are you more advanced in Python, then there is a track for you as well. Do you have your own project, then simply bring it along!
