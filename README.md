# python-essentials-series
In the Essential Python Series we embark on a hands-on immersion into different aspects of the Python language, build small projects and learn Pythonic practices along the way.

## First Steps 


In this session, we start installing  PyCharm Community Edition Integrated Development
Environment (IDE). You will:
 
* set up your first PyCharm project with a python virtual environment
* run  your first python project
* understand python code layout and learn enough Python syntax to get you started with your Roll the Dice Project

For those who want to learn more, there is an additional project,  and a quiz to 
  assess  what you have learned...let's take our [first steps..](https://github.com/pyladieshamburg/python-essentials-series/tree/master/first-steps)!
  
## Operations with Functions and Lists

Now that you are more comfortable using your IDE, its time to put your skills to use by 
designing and writing your *own* Python code.
 
As you write code, it's good practice to organize your work in a  modular and reusable manner. So we 
will begin with [A First Start Writing Function](https://github.com/pyladieshamburg/python-essentials-series/tree/master/functions_lists#part-i-functions). 

What will our Functions do? ... You guessed it ... operate on [Lists](https://github.com/pyladieshamburg/python-essentials-series/tree/master/functions_lists#part-ii-lists). 

##  Parallel Track
Advanced: Are you more advanced in Python, then there is a track for you as well. Do you have your own project, then simply bring it along!
